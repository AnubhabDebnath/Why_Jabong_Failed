This depository contains the casestudy of why one of the biggest players in the clothing market - "Jabong" failed to stay there just after a few years of giving tough competition to other competing brands like Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal etc. I had to a lot of research about the company, its uprising in the market as well as its downfall and derive a few reasons how it could've been prevented.

The failure of Jabong can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the emergence of new competitors in the market, PR or media reputation damage, socioeconomic causes, and poor business decisions made to cope with market demand. There could be four major causes like -
   1. New competitor in Market
   2. PR or Media reputation damage
   3. Socioeconomic causes
   4. Business Decisions to cope up with the market demand

New Competitors: 
The Indian e-commerce market was highly competitive, and new players entered the market regularly. Jabong struggled to maintain its market share as competition intensified. It also did’nt have a USP(Unique Selling Product).

PR or Media Reputation Damage:
Jabong struggled with negative publicity and a damaged reputation in the media. This may have contributed to a decline in customer trust and loyalty.

Socioeconomic Causes: 
The Indian e-commerce market faced a number of socioeconomic challenges, including poor logistics and delivery infrastructure, which made it difficult for Jabong to maintain the level of service and customer satisfaction that it needed to remain competitive

Business Decisions:
Jabong struggled to keep up with the market demand. Business decisions like not keeping up with the market trends, not expanding the product line, not focusing on customer service, and not being able to sustain with the price war were some of the reasons for its failure. All the founders left too frequently which lead to the overall imbalance in the company. Overall, Jabong's failure can be attributed to a combination of internal and external factors, including intense competition, poor business decisions, and socioeconomic challenges.
